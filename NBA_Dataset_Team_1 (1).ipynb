However, there may be factors that may reject the hypothesis that more playing time leads to higher point totals. These include and not limited to the players role on the team, the defensive matchups and the efficiency or how well the player plays.  This research will seek to examine the hypothesis that NBA players who receive more playing time will consistently score more points than those who play fewer minutes."
